# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis – Red & White Wines

This project presents a comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning modeling** on the popular Wine Quality Dataset. It explores what makes wine "good" using red and white wine samples.

## 📌 Project Highlights

✅ Comparative EDA on red vs. white wine
✅ Identification of key features affecting wine quality
✅ Machine learning models for wine quality prediction
✅ Clean visualizations and well-commented notebooks
✅ Deployed with datasets and code for reproducibility

## 🧠 Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and correlations.
* Discover key factors that influence wine quality.
* Train classification models to predict quality ratings.
* Compare patterns between red and white wine characteristics.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – ML modeling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights

* **Alcohol content** was a strong positive influencer of quality in both red and white wines.
* **Volatile acidity** showed a negative correlation with quality, especially in red wine.
* Random Forest models performed best in predicting quality levels.
* Red and white wines share some common quality influencers but differ in concentration ranges.
